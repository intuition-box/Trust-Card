# Chest

When you mint a Trust Card, you do **not** receive the [card](./nft.mdx) directly.  
Instead, you obtain a **Chest** â€” a sealed container that defines the **rarity** of the future card.  

Burning the chest later unlocks the actual **[NFT card](./nft.mdx)**.

---

## Concept of the Chest

- The **Chest** is a transitional NFT between the [mint](./mint.mdx) and the final [card](./nft.mdx).  
- Each chest carries a **rarity tier**, visually distinct and tied to different outcomes.  
- The **rarity of the chest** depends on the [wave](./waves.mdx) in which it was minted.  
- Once burned, the chest disappears and reveals the card it contained.  
- Chests are not tradable: they exist only as **keys to unlock cards**.

## Rarity Tiers

| Tier        | Visual Identity                        |
|-------------|----------------------------------------|
| **Common**   | Simple chest, faint glow               |
| **Rare**     | Metallic patterns, brighter glow       |
| **Epic**     | Colored aura, animated effects         |
| **Legendary**| Golden aura, radiant energy            |
| **Ancient**  | Covered in runes, shifting aura        |
| **Mystic**   | Multicolor energy, unique animations   |

ðŸ‘‰ These tiers define the **visual and symbolic identity** of the chest, building anticipation for the reveal of the final card.

## Chest â†’ Card

1. **[Minting](./mint.mdx)** creates a **Chest**.  
2. The holder may keep it sealed or **burn it at any time**.  
3. Burning destroys the chest NFT and generates the **[final Trust Card NFT](./nft.mdx)**.  

This two-step process builds **suspense**, **exclusivity**, and adds a layer of **collection strategy**.

## Connection with Relics

- For **[Relic Holders](./relic-holder.mdx)**, the relic itself acts as the chest.  
- In this case, minting does not create a generic chest: the card is revealed **directly from the relic** when burned.  

---

## ðŸ“Œ Summary

- A **Chest** is the outcome of minting, not the card itself.  
- **Rarity of the chest** is defined by the wave.  
- Burning the chest reveals the **final NFT card**.  
- Special case: **Relics** replace the chest for relic holders.
