# Domains

Each Trust Card can be linked to a **personal domain name**, a simple and shareable identity that redirects to the holderâ€™s **social.card** page.  
This makes trust, reputation, and identity easy to access and verify.

## Free Domains for Early [Waves](./waves.mdx)

- **Wave 1 & Wave 2 holders** receive a **free** domain under **.trust.box**  
  â†’ Example: `alice.trust.box`  
- From **Wave 3 onwards**, domains will still be available but will be **paid**.  

ðŸ‘‰ This rewards the **earliest adopters** with a permanent perk, while still allowing later waves to access the same identity feature.

## Migration to .trust

In the future (target around **2028**), if the **.trust TLD** is acquired,  
holders of a `.trust.box` domain will be able to **migrate** to a direct `.trust` name.  

- Example: `alice.trust.box` â†’ `alice.trust`  
- Migration will preserve links and reputation so that the trust graph remains intact.

---

## Featured Extensions

- **.box** â†’ a simple and universal extension.  
- **.trust.box** â†’ the default and free option for Waves 1 & 2.  
- **.trust** â†’ the long-term vision, dependent on acquiring the TLD.

## ðŸ“Œ Summary

- **Domains provide clear identity**: a simple URL pointing to the social.card.  
- **Free for Waves 1 & 2** â†’ `.trust.box` included with each card.  
- **Paid for later waves** â†’ domains remain available but not free.  
- **Future migration** â†’ `.trust.box` can become `.trust` if the TLD is acquired.
