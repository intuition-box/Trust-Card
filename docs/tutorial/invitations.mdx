# Invitations

Each **Trust Card holder** receives a number of **invitations** to onboard new members into the ecosystem.  
Invitations are a key mechanism for **controlled growth** and for building the **trust graph**.

---

## How Invitations Work

- The **first holders of Wave 1** receive their cards as a **direct offer**.  
- Invitations begin **after this initial distribution**.  
- Invitations are **limited**.  
- They can be **unlocked gradually over time**, or once the holder reaches a certain **trust score**.  
- When sending an invitation, the holder may also choose to **trust** the invited person.  
- The invitee can then **trust back**, creating a reciprocal connection.  

---

## Multiple Invitations to the Same Person

- If several people invite the same user:  
  - The **first invitation is flagged** as already sent.  
  - However, the user can still establish **trust relationships** with the other inviters.  

ðŸ‘‰ This ensures that **trust links** can still form even if the invitation slot is already consumed.

---

## Connection with Waves

- Each **wave** distributes a limited number of cards.  
- With each card comes invitations, allowing holders to expand the network.  
- ðŸ‘‰ For more context on rarity and supply per wave, see the [Waves tutorial](./waves.mdx).

## Link to Trust Graph and Domains of Trust

- The invitation system directly feeds into the **[Trust Graph](./trust-graph.mdx)**:  
  - Who invited whom  
  - Who trusted back  
  - How reputation flows
  - ...

- Beyond trusting invitees, holders can also **trust the inviters** themselves, as well as other card holders.  

- Invitations may also be tied to **specific domains of trust** (e.g. *Development*, *NFTs*, *Security*, *Social*, ...).  
  - These domains are connected to both the **[Trust Graph](./rust-graph.mdx)** and the **[Reputation Checker](./reputation-checker.mdx)**, making trust contextual and measurable across different fields.

## ðŸ“Œ Summary

- **Wave 1 cards** are distributed as a **direct offer**.  
- After that, **invitations drive expansion** of the community.  
- Invitations are **scarce**, tied to **trust scores** and **time-based unlocks**.  
- They form the **links of the trust graph**, connected to **domains of trust** and the **reputation checker**.
