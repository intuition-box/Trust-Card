# Mint Ceremony

The **minting** of a Trust Card is not just a technical step: it is an **immersive experience** designed to highlight rarity, identity, and prestige.

---

## Experience Stages

1. **Animated intro (suspense)**  
   - A cinematic sequence builds anticipation and creates **suspense** before the reveal.  
   - The intro may vary depending on the wave or rarity tier.  

2. **Interactive 3D reveal**  
   - The card appears as a fully interactive 3D model (rotate, zoom, explore).  
   - Special visual effects (lighting, particles, colors) emphasize rarity.  

3. **Static high-resolution frame**  
   - A static image is generated for easy sharing (galleries, profiles, social media).

## Link with Rarity

- **Rarity probabilities** depend on the wave (see [Waves](./waves.mdx)).  
- **Rare, Epic, and Legendary** cards can trigger unique animations or special effects during the reveal.  
- Example: a Legendary might glow, emit particles, or unlock an exclusive design element.
