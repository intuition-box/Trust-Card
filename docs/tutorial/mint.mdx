# Mint Ceremony

The **minting** of a Trust Card is not just a technical step: it is an **immersive experience** designed to highlight rarity, identity, and prestige.  

Minting does **not immediately reveal the [card](./nft.mdx)**. Instead, it grants a **[Chest](./chest.mdx)** â€” or, in the case of **[Relic Holders](./relic-holder.mdx)**, the relic itself acts as the chest.  
The final card is only obtained once the chest (or relic) is **burned**.

## Experience Stages

1. **Animated intro (suspense)**  
   - A cinematic sequence builds anticipation and creates **suspense** before the reveal.  
   - The intro may vary depending on the wave or rarity tier.  

2. **Interactive 3D chest reveal**  
   - Instead of the card, a **[chest](./chest.mdx)** materializes as a fully interactive 3D object (rotate, zoom, explore).  
   - Special effects (lighting, particles, aura) emphasize the chestâ€™s rarity.  

3. **Static high-resolution frame**  
   - A static image of the chest is generated for sharing or collection logs.  
   - Later, burning the chest unlocks the **card reveal**.

## Link with Rarity

- **Rarity probabilities** depend on the wave (see [Waves](./waves.mdx)).  
- The **rarity of the chest** determines the potential rarity of the final card.  
- Example: a Legendary chest might glow, emit particles, or carry exclusive design details.

## Connections with Other Features

- The **[Chest](./chest.mdx)** is the direct outcome of the ceremony (or the **[Relic](./relic-holder.mdx)** for special holders).  
- Burning the chest reveals the **[NFT Card](./nft.mdx)**.  
- The **[Physical Card](./physical-card.mdx)** mirrors the design and rarity revealed through this process.  
- The **[Trust Graph](./trust-graph.mdx)** and **[Reputation Checker](./reputation-checker.mdx)** integrate minted cards into the social reputation network.

## ðŸ“Œ Summary

The mint ceremony is:  
- A **visual and interactive experience**,  
- Leading to the acquisition of a **chest or relic** (not the card directly),  
- Where chest rarity (defined by the wave) sets the stage for the cardâ€™s rarity,  
- Bridging digital (NFT) and physical (card) identity,  
- Anchoring Trust Cards into the **social and reputation-driven ecosystem** of Intuition.
