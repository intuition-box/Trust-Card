# NFT

At the heart of the project, every Trust Card is a **3D NFT**.  
It is both a **collectible object** and a **key to trust and reputation** within the Intuition ecosystem.

---

## Formats & Visual Layers

Each NFT combines multiple visual experiences:

1. **Animated intro** â†’ immersive sequence at [mint](./mint.mdx).  
2. **Interactive 3D model** â†’ rotate, zoom, and freely explore the card.  
3. **Static high-resolution frame** â†’ a shareable version for galleries, profiles, or social media.

## Metadata

Each Trust Card NFT includes structured metadata:

- **[Wave](./waves.mdx)** (which minting wave it belongs to).  
- **Rarity** (Common, Rare, Epic, Legendary).  
- **Holder identity** (avatar or personalized representation).  
- **Trust elements** (optional links to trust score, graph connections).  
- **Relics bonus** (if the holder also owns a Relics NFT, special visuals or metadata may be unlocked).  

ðŸ‘‰ These metadata ensure cards are **unique, verifiable, and meaningful**.

---

## Rarity & Prestige

- Rarity is influenced by the **minting [wave](./waves.mdx)** (earlier = higher chances of rare cards).  
- Each rarity tier has **distinct visual elements** (frames, colors, effects).  
- **Legendary cards** may include **exclusive animations** or additional design layers.

## Connection with Other Features

- The **[Mint Ceremony](./mint.mdx)** showcases the animated intro and 3D reveal.  
- The **[Physical Card](./physical-card.mdx)** mirrors the NFTâ€™s wave and rarity visually.  
- The **[Trust Graph](./trust-graph.mdx)** and **[Reputation Checker](./reputation-checker.mdx)** use NFT ownership as the entry point into the social reputation network.
