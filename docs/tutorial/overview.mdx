## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose & Benefits

Trust Card is designed as the **gateway into Intuition**.  

Beyond being just an NFT, it is a mechanism for **[access](./invitations.mdx), [experience](./mint.mdx), and [reputation](./reputation-checker.mdx)**.  
Each wave introduces scarcity, each mint strengthens the sense of belonging, and every invitation consolidates the [Trust Graph](./trust-graph.mdx), paving the way for a community that grows progressively and with trust.  

For Intuition, this means :
- **controlled onboarding**,
- an **immersive and rewarding experience** through [3D NFTs](./nft.mdx) and [physical editions](./physical-card.mdx),
- and an **engaged, high-quality community**, strengthened by the involvement of **[KOLs (Key Opinion Leaders)](./waves.mdx)** who attract new members while consolidating trust.

## ðŸŒ€ The Big Picture

Trust Card is a system where **3D NFT cards** are not only collectibles, but also **invitations** and **proofs of trust**.  

1. Cards are released in **[Waves](./waves.mdx)** â†’ each wave has a limited supply and unique rarity probabilities.  
2. Every cardholder can onboard others through **[Invitations](./invitations.mdx)** â†’ but invitations are scarce and unlock gradually or based on trust score.  
3. The **[Minting Ceremony](./mint.mdx)** turns minting into a ritualized experience â†’ animated intro, 3D reveal, collectible frame.  
4. Minting gives a **[Chest](./chest.mdx)** instead of a card.  
   - For **[Relic Holders](./relic-holder.mdx)**, the relic itself acts as the chest.  
5. Burning the chest (or relic) reveals the **[NFT Card](./nft.mdx)** â†’ interactive, animated, and collectible.  
6. Some NFTs can also exist as **[Physical Editions](./physical-card.mdx)** â†’ premium prints, QR code, NFC chip.  
7. All invitations and trust actions feed into the **[Trust Graph](./trust-graph.mdx)** â†’ a living map of connections.  
8. The **[Reputation Checker](./reputation-checker.mdx)** lets anyone explore profiles, trust links, and degrees of separation.  
9. Each card can optionally include a **[Personal Domain](./domain.mdx)** â†’ a shareable identity hub with profile, connections, and external links.
