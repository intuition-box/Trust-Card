# Trust Card Overview

This guide walks through the project step by step, showing how **waves, invitations, minting, chests, cards, trust, and reputation** all connect together.

## ðŸŒ€ The Big Picture

Trust Card is a system where **3D NFT cards** are not only collectibles, but also **invitations** and **proofs of trust**.  

1. Cards are released in **[Waves](./waves.mdx)** â†’ each wave has a limited supply and unique rarity probabilities.  
2. Every cardholder can onboard others through **[Invitations](./invitations.mdx)** â†’ but invitations are scarce and unlock gradually or based on trust score.  
3. The **[Minting Ceremony](./mint.mdx)** turns minting into a ritualized experience â†’ animated intro, 3D reveal, collectible frame.  
4. Minting gives a **[Chest](./chest.mdx)** instead of a card.  
   - For **[Relic Holders](./relic-holder.mdx)**, the relic itself acts as the chest.  
5. Burning the chest (or relic) reveals the **[NFT Card](./nft.mdx)** â†’ interactive, animated, and collectible.  
6. Some NFTs can also exist as **[Physical Editions](./physical-card.mdx)** â†’ premium prints, QR code, NFC chip.  
7. All invitations and trust actions feed into the **[Trust Graph](./trust-graph.mdx)** â†’ a living map of connections.  
8. The **[Reputation Checker](./reputation-checker.mdx)** lets anyone explore profiles, trust links, and degrees of separation.  
9. Each card can optionally include a **[Personal Domain](./domain.mdx)** â†’ a shareable identity hub with profile, connections, and external links.

## ðŸ”— How Everything Connects

- **[Waves](./waves.mdx)** define **who enters first** and how rare their cards can be.  
- **[Invitations](./invitations.mdx)** are the gateway for onboarding new members, tied to scarcity and trust score.  
- The **[Minting Ceremony](./mint.mdx)** makes acquisition a memorable, ritualized event.  
- **[Chests](./chest.mdx)** (or [relics](./relic-holder.mdx)) act as the intermediate container before receiving the card.  
- **[NFT Cards](./nft.mdx)** provide identity, rarity, and status â†’ optionally extended with **[physical editions](./physical-card.mdx)**.  
- Each action updates the **[Trust Graph](./trust-graph.mdx)**, the backbone of the ecosystem.  
- The **[Reputation Checker](./reputation-checker.mdx)** builds on this â†’ search, measure trust, explore separation.  
- **[Domains](./domain.mdx)** anchor digital identity, turning cards into shareable hubs.
