This guide walks through the project step by step, showing how **cards, invitations, trust, reputation, and design** all connect together.

## ðŸŒ€ The Big Picture

Trust Card is a system where **3D NFT cards** are not only collectibles, but also **invitations** and **proofs of trust**.  

1. Cards are released in **[Waves](./waves.mdx)** â†’ each wave has a limited supply and different rarity probabilities.  
2. Card holders receive **[Invitations](./invitations.mdx)** â†’ these bring new members into the ecosystem.  
3. Every invitation and trust link feeds into the **[Trust Graph](./trust-graph.mdx)** â†’ a visual map of relationships.  
4. Users can explore trust and reputation with the **[Reputation Checker](./reputation-checker.mdx)** â†’ search for anyone, view their trust links, and measure degrees of separation.  
5. The NFTs themselves are designed as **[3D Cards](./nft.mdx)** â†’ interactive, animated, and collectible.  
6. The minting process is special, with a full **[Mint Ceremony](./mint.mdx)** â†’ animated intro, interactive 3D model, static frame.  
7. Some cards may also exist as **[Physical Editions](./physical-card.mdx)** â†’ premium print, QR code, NFC chip.  
8. Each card can optionally include a **[Personal Domain](./domain.mdx)** â†’ a shareable identity page.

## ðŸ”— How Everything Connects

- **Waves** define **who gets in first** and how rare their cards are.  
- **Invitations** let holders onboard others, but theyâ€™re **scarce** and tied to **trust score** and **time unlocks**.  
- Each invitation and trust action updates the **Trust Graph**, the living map of the ecosystem.  
- The **Reputation Checker** builds on this, letting you search, measure trust, and see **how many degrees away** someone is.  
- **NFT formats, mint ceremony, and physical cards** ensure the experience is both **digital and tangible**.  
- **Domain names** give holders a personalized identity linked to their Trust Card.

- **Scarcity** comes from **waves** and rarity probabilities.  
- **Growth** comes from **invitations**, unlocking new members.  
- **Reputation** comes from the **trust graph** and **score checker**.  
- **Identity** comes from **NFT design**, **physical editions**, and **personal domains**.
