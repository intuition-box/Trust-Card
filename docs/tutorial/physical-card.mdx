# Physical Card

Beyond the digital edition (3D [NFT](./nft.mdx)), some **Trust Cards** may also exist as **physical cards**.  
These cards bridge the **digital world** and the **physical world**, offering both prestige and utility at events.  

ðŸ‘‰ A physical card can only exist as an extension of a **revealed [NFT](./nft.mdx)** â€” itself accessible through an [Invitation](./invitations.mdx) â†’ [Mint Ceremony](./mint.mdx) â†’ [Chest](./chest.mdx) or [Relic](./relic-holder.mdx).

## Features

- **Premium print**: high-quality materials, limited edition per wave.  
- **Distinctive elements**: each physical card reflects both:  
  - the **design of its [wave](./waves.mdx)** (frame, colors, specific motifs),  
  - its **rarity tier** from [chest](./chest.mdx) or card (Common, Rare, Epic, Legendary, Ancient, Mystic).  
- **Recto (front side)**:  
  - personalized **avatar of the holder**,  
  - additional **data from the Intuition protocol** (e.g. trust score, badges, domains of trust).  
- **Verso (back side)**:  
  - **QR code** â†’ instant redirection to the corresponding [NFT](./nft.mdx),  
  - small **snapshot of the trust graph**, showing a simplified view of the holderâ€™s connections.  
- **NFC chip** â†’ direct access to a *[social.card3](https://card3.ai)*-style profile page:  
  - presentation of the holder,  
  - personalized links (website, socials, projects).  
- **Format & holder** â†’ to be defined (e.g. metal, acrylic, premium packaging, or custom display case).

## Prestige & Usage

- Physical cards give holders a **symbol of status**.  
- They can serve as a **badge of trust** at IRL events (conferences, meetups, hackathonsâ€¦).

## Link to Waves and Rarity

- Physical cards mirror the **visual identity of each [wave](./waves.mdx)**.  
- They also integrate a **rarity distinction**, allowing clear visual differentiation between Common, Rare, Epic, Legendary, Ancient, and Mystic holders.  
- Some physical editions may be **reserved for early waves** (e.g. Wave 1), while others could be **opened more broadly**.
