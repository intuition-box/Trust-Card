# Relic Holder

For some pioneers of Intuition, [minting](./mint.mdx) a Trust Card works differently.  
Instead of receiving a generic **[Chest](./chest.mdx)**, they use their **Relic NFT** as the container of rarity.  

The relic itself acts as the **key** and the **vessel** from which the card will emerge.

## Concept of the Relic

- A **Relic** is a special NFT tied to the Intuition ecosystem.  
- When a relic holder mints, no new chest is created.  
- The **relic itself becomes the chest**, and holds the potential rarity inside.  
- When burned, the relic reveals the **[final Trust Card](./nft.mdx)**.  
- Holders with **multiple relics** can mint **multiple times** â€” one card per relic.

## Visual Identity

Relics are visually distinct and carry their own aura of prestige:  

- **Ancient symbols** carved into the surface  
- **Shifting aura** that reflects rarity potential  
- **Unique animations** not found in standard chests  

ðŸ‘‰ This makes relic holders instantly recognizable as early pioneers in the ecosystem.

## Relic â†’ Card

1. **Minting with a relic** does not produce a chest.  
2. The relic itself becomes the sealed container.  
3. Burning the relic unlocks the **final Trust Card** directly.  
4. If you own **several relics**, you can repeat the process: **each relic unlocks its own card**.

## ðŸ“Œ Summary

- Relic holders bypass the generic chest system.  
- Their **Relic NFT is the chest**.  
- Burning the relic reveals the card inside.  
- Owning **multiple relics = multiple cards** (one per relic).  
- Relics mark **prestige, early access, and recognition** within Intuition.
