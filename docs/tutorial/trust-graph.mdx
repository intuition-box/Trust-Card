# Trust Graph

The **Trust Graph** is the visual and structural backbone of Trust Card.  
It shows how **invitations**, **trust links**, and **card ownership** connect people into a reputation network.

---

## What the Trust Graph Shows

- **Invitations**: who invited whom.  
- **Trust links**: who trusted whom, and which connections are mutual (*trust back*).  
- **Card holders**: all NFT holders are nodes in the graph.  
- **Reputation flow**: how trust propagates through direct and indirect links.  

👉 For more on how invitations trigger trust links, see the [Invitations tutorial](./invitations.mdx).  

---

## Building Relationships

- When a holder sends an invitation, they can **trust the invitee**.  
- The invitee can **trust back**, creating a reciprocal connection.  
- Holders can also **trust the inviters themselves**, as well as **other card holders** beyond their direct invitees.  

This creates a **dense and interconnected web of trust**.

---

## Domains of Trust

- Trust links can be **domain-specific**
- Domains make trust **contextual**, allowing someone to be highly trusted in one area but neutral in another.  
- 👉 Domains are directly tied to the **[Reputation Checker](./reputation-checker.mdx)**, which calculates trust scores both globally and by domain.  

---

## Visualization

The Trust Graph will be **visualized dynamically**, similar to tools like *Gource* or interactive network explorers.  

Users will be able to:  
- Click on a profile to view direct and indirect connections.  
- See **mutual links** (e.g. “5 people you trust also trust this person”).  
- Measure **degrees of separation** between themselves and others.  
- Filter by **domains of trust** to explore contextual reputation.  
- 👉 The **[Reputation Checker](./reputation-checker.mdx)** will let users **search for anyone**, see their trust links, and calculate **how many degrees of separation** they are away from them in the graph.

## Summary

- The **Trust Graph** is a **visual map of the ecosystem**, built from invitations, trust links, and card ownership.  
- It shows **who invited whom**, **who trusts whom**, and **how trust spreads**.  
- Trust is **contextual** through domains, connected to the **Reputation Checker**.  
- 👉 With the Reputation Checker, users will be able to **search for anyone**, explore their trust links, and measure their **distance in degrees of separation**.  
- The graph is central to making Trust Card both **social** and **reputation-driven**.
