# Trust Graph

The **Trust Graph** is the visual and structural backbone of Trust Card.  
It shows how **invitations**, **minted cards**, and **trust links** connect people into a living reputation network.  

---

## What the Trust Graph Shows

- **[Invitations](./invitations.mdx)** → who invited whom into the ecosystem.  
- **Card holders** → each minted [NFT](./nft.mdx) (from a [Chest](./chest.mdx) or [Relic](./relic-holder.mdx)) becomes a **node** in the graph.  
- **Trust links** → who trusts whom, and which connections are mutual (*trust back*).  
- **Reputation flow** → how trust propagates through direct and indirect links.  

👉 Invitations open the door to [minting](./mint.mdx), and minting creates the nodes that populate the graph.  

---

## Building Relationships

- When a holder sends an [invitation](./invitations.mdx), they can also **trust the invitee**.  
- The invitee can **trust back**, creating a reciprocal link.  
- Trust can also extend beyond direct invitations: holders may **trust inviters** or **other card holders**.  

This creates a **dense and interconnected web of trust**.  

---

## Domains of Trust

- Trust links can be **domain-specific** (e.g. *Development*, *NFTs*, *Security*, *Community*…).  
- Domains make trust **contextual**, allowing someone to be highly trusted in one field but neutral in another.  
- 👉 Domains are directly tied to the **[Reputation Checker](./reputation-checker.mdx)**, which calculates trust scores both globally and by domain.  

---

## Visualization

The Trust Graph will be **visualized dynamically**, similar to interactive network explorers.  

Users will be able to:  
- Click on a profile to view direct and indirect connections.  
- See **mutual trust links** (e.g. “5 people you trust also trust this person”).  
- Measure **degrees of separation** from anyone else.  
- Filter by **domains of trust** to explore contextual reputation.  
- 👉 The **[Reputation Checker](./reputation-checker.mdx)** lets you **search for anyone**, view their links, and calculate how far away they are in the network.

## 📌 Summary

- The **Trust Graph** is a **visual map of the ecosystem**, built from invitations, minted cards, and trust links.  
- Each **invitation + mint** adds a new node, connected through trust relationships.  
- Trust is **contextual** through domains, connected directly to the **Reputation Checker**.  
- The graph turns Trust Card into a **social reputation system**, not just a collectible.
