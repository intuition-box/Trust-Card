# Waves ‚Äî Limited Supply & Rarity

**Trust Cards** are released in **successive waves**, each with a **limited number of cards** and a **specific rarity distribution**. This phased release ensures **prestige for early adopters** and creates a controlled progression for community growth.

---

## Concept of Waves

- Each wave represents a **minting phase** with:
  - a **supply cap** (e.g. 500 cards in Wave 1),
  - a **different rarity probability** (earlier waves have higher chances of rare cards),
  - a **defined target audience**.
- Once the supply of a wave is exhausted, the **next wave** opens.
- Each wave is visually distinct, so collectors can immediately recognize the edition of a card.

üëâ This mechanism combines **scarcity and community expansion**.

---

## Rarity Distribution per Wave

- **Wave 1**: higher probability of minting **Rare / Legendary** cards. Target: **Web3 / crypto personalities** who are not yet part of the Intuition circle.
- **Wave 2**: balanced distribution (more Commons, fewer Rares). Target: **other Web3 personalities**, still outside the Intuition circle.
- **Waves 3‚Äì4**: lower chance of Legendary, mostly Common / Rare.
- **Wave 0** (special edition): reserved for Intuition‚Äôs pioneers (e.g. *Relics* holders).

Example distribution (illustrative only):

| Wave   | Supply | Common | Rare | Epic | Legendary |
|--------|--------|--------|------|------|-----------|
| Wave 1 | 500    | 50%    | 30%  | 15%  | 5%        |
| Wave 2 | 1000   | 65%    | 25%  | 8%   | 2%        |
| Wave 3 | 2000   | 75%    | 20%  | 4%   | 1%        |
| Wave 0 | TBD    | ???    | ???  | ???  | ???       |

## Why Waves?

1. **Prestige & Status**  
   - Early holders have rarer, more visible cards.  
   - This creates exclusivity and prestige for early adopters.  

2. **Controlled Growth**  
   - The community expands gradually instead of opening to everyone at once.  
   - Each wave introduces a new layer of Web3 personalities and users.  

3. **Invitation System**  
   - Each wave relies on **invitations** to bring in new members.  
   - üëâ See the [Invitations tutorial](./invitations.mdx) for more details.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Implementation

Each wave is defined in the smart contract with its own configuration:  

```solidity
struct WaveConfig {
    uint256 supplyCap;        // Maximum number of cards in the wave
    uint256 minted;           // Already minted
    uint8[4] rarityWeights;   // Probability weights [Common, Rare, Epic, Legendary]
    uint256 startTime;        // Wave start
    uint256 endTime;          // Wave end
}
