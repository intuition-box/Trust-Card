# Waves â€” Limited Supply & Rarity

**Trust Cards** are released in **successive waves**, each with a **limited number of cards** and a **specific rarity distribution**.  
This phased release ensures **prestige for early adopters** and creates a controlled progression for community growth.

---

## Concept of Waves

- Each wave represents a **[minting phase](./mint.mdx)** with:
  - a **supply cap** (e.g. 500 cards in Wave 1),
  - a **different rarity probability** (earlier waves increase the chances of higher-tier rewards),
  - a **defined target audience**.
- Once the supply of a wave is exhausted, the **next wave** opens.
- Each wave is visually distinct, so collectors can immediately recognize the edition of a card.

ðŸ‘‰ Importantly: the **wave determines the rarity of the [chest](./chest.mdx)** you receive.  
Burning that chest (or [relic](./relic-holder.mdx), for special holders) later defines the rarity of the final card.

---

## Rarity Distribution per Wave

- **Wave 1**: higher probability of minting **Rare / Legendary** chests. Target: **Web3 / crypto personalities** not yet part of the Intuition circle.  
- **Wave 2**: more balanced distribution (more Common chests, fewer Rare/Legendary). Target: **other Web3 builders**, still outside the Intuition circle.  
- **Waves 3â€“4**: lower chance of Legendary, mostly Common / Rare chests.  
- **Wave 0** (special edition): reserved for Intuitionâ€™s pioneers (e.g. *Relic holders*).  

Example distribution (illustrative only):

| Wave   | Supply | Common | Rare | Epic | Legendary |
|--------|--------|--------|------|------|-----------|
| Wave 1 | 500    | 50%    | 30%  | 15%  | 5%        |
| Wave 2 | 1000   | 65%    | 25%  | 8%   | 2%        |
| Wave 3 | 2000   | 75%    | 20%  | 4%   | 1%        |
| Wave 0 | TBD    | ???    | ???  | ???  | ???       |

## Why Waves?

1. **Prestige & Status**  
   - Early holders obtain rarer [chests](./chest.mdx), which can reveal more prestigious cards.  
   - This creates exclusivity and visible recognition for early adopters.  

2. **Controlled Growth**  
   - The community expands gradually instead of opening to everyone at once.  
   - Each wave introduces a new layer of Web3 personalities and users.  

3. **Invitation System**  
   - Each wave relies on **invitations** to bring in new members.  
   - ðŸ‘‰ See the [Invitations tutorial](./invitations.mdx) for more details.
